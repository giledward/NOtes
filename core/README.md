# Core

Shared domain logic for NOtes will live here (models, parsing, search indexing). This folder is scaffolded for upcoming implementations.

- `entities.ts` contains the core domain interfaces (notes, clipboard items, tags, snippets) plus shared metadata like timestamps, source attribution, pinning, and deduplication fields.
