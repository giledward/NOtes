# Stack choices

- **UI stack:** React + Vite + TypeScript for a fast, component-first frontend with great DX.
- **State management:** Zustand keeps state minimal and ergonomic while we scope the data model.
- **Routing:** React Router v6 powers the shell navigation for Notes and Clipboard views.
- **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript enforce consistent style, type-safety, and formatting. Vite handles dev/build/preview workflows.

## Running the UI shell

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Preview and production bundles are available via `npm run preview` and `npm run build` respectively.
